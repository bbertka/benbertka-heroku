    Associate Systems Engineer | EMC <br><small>September 2014 - Current, Bellevue, WA</small></h5>
    <p>
       Currently I am an enterprise pre-sales account systems engineer with a focus on IT infrastructure sales to enterprise accounts. I am assigned to T-Mobile working closely with DevOps and storage teams. My technical focus is Big Data, Cloud, and DevOps, where I have created POC applications using a variety of technologies including: Hortonworks, Cloud Foundry, Heroku, Splunk, Web2Py, Python, and Ruby (currently learning).  I used prior security experience to identify issues with access control and identity management, and coordinated with RSA to deliver an enterprise-wide solution.

    </h5>
    <p>
        Previously I worked in cyber-security operations as a member of the TELUS Cyber Threat Intelligence, and Red Team.  In this role I performed high level adversary aware threat risk assessments of critical LTE infrastructure.  I also built a threat intelligence platform using the open source Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF) toolkit along with Python to allow easy web based searching by incident handlers. As part of my role, I worked closely with Access Management, and Architecture Compliance teams to create functional/technical RFI/RFP requirements for technology including a new Access and Identity Management System, as well as a Malware Sandbox.

        Intrusion Prevention System Analyst | Fortinet Technologies<br><small>August 2012 - July 2013, Burnaby, BC</small>
    </h5>
     <p>
This was my most technical and challenging position where I was part of a product R&D team for the IPS functionality of the Fortinet Fortigate hardware appliance.
    </p>
<ul>
 <li>Owned development and upkeep of evasion tool IPS signature base for the FortiGate appliance</li>
<li>Reverse engineered x86 binaries specific to network vulnerability and malware analysis</li>
<li>Analyzed TCP/UDP traffic captures from deep packet inspection (DPI) using Wireshark</li>
<li>Developed FortiGate IPS packet signatures to detect and control vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Optimized intrusion and application control sensors by using PCRE Regular Expressions</li>
<li>Diagnosed and implemented solutions to escalated tickets related to application control</li>
<li>Cross-trained with the Anti-Virus team in behavioral, static, and dynamic malware analysis</li>
<li>Applied the techniques malware analysis to perform IPS analysis for application control</li>
<li>Managed an IPS unit and security lab environment with VMWare, VirtualBox, Hubs and Switches</li>
</ul>
<h6>Special Project: Remote Application Data Harvester</h6><p>
I reverse engineered all aspects of the Ultrasurf HTTP proxy tool and created an application simulator to harvest dynamically allocated IP addresses from a remote server. Specifically I attached Ultrasurf to OllyDbg, and isolated traffic using a Fortigate IPS unit, restricting traffic flow through encryption facilities in the debugger.  I reversed the PGP crypto system that provided proxy IPs by locating the private key and re-implementing the encryption algorithm. The result was a system that decrypted PGP messages, harvested IP addresses, and auto-generated IPS signatures.
