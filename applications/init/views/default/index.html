                <p>I reverse engineered all aspects of the Ultrasurf HTTP proxy tool and created an application simulator to harvest dynamically allocated IP addresses from a remote server. Specifically I attached Ultrasurf to OllyDbg, and isolated traffic using a Fortigate IPS unit, restricting traffic flow through encryption facilities in the debugger.  I reversed the PGP crypto system that provided proxy IPs by locating the private key and re-implementing the encryption algorithm. The result was a system that decrypted PGP messages, harvested IP addresses, and auto-generated IPS signatures.</p>
